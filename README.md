# GroupProjectFinalDeliverable

CryptoPals Challenge Set 1, Group 3 <br /> <br />

This project was a group collaborative to complete CryptoPals Set 1 Challenges 1-7 for insight into project management and the software engineering process. Group 3 completed this collaborative project successfully, and according to our initial planning phases. For this project, we used Discord to share documents and collaborate throughout the project, C++ to code, and GitHub to merge the code. It was difficult to merge code through that program, prior to the lesson on GitHub. This program made merging the code very easy. That was the main challenge we faced throughout the duration of this project. Challenge 7 was also very difficult and took many members of the team to complete. 
<br />
To run the project, simply clone the project. All files required are attached and work accordingly. To test each challenge, you'll want to have the following inputs ready (though some input can vary, these are the inputs required from the CryptoPals Challenge Site): <br />
        1: 49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d <br />
        2: 1c0111001f010100061a024b53535009181c <br />

Those are the only input that is needed; the text for the remaining challenges are in attached files. <br /> <br />

Note: Not everyone had to merge a challenge as a few of us worked together on some of the challenges, so those challenges were merged in by one of the contributors. Everyone did their part on completing challenges though.
For example Feizal assisted Rubina with challenges 3 and 4, which Rubina merged onto the GUI along with challenge 8. Feizal also created the first version of the GUI that was then refined and used to merge all the challenge code.
